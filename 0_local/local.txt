1. functions - direxits ( checks if the dir exit or not, if checked for a file it will thow error)
    example output "example_output_homedir" {
  value = provider::local::direxists(pathexpand("~/.ssh")) ( in my case false)
    }
    
2. reasources - filename and any one of this are required or will throw error

    content, source, content_base64, sensitive_content 

    - source can be used to copy a file into the new file we are making 
    - content  can be used to incert information into a file
    - content_base64 can be used for secure transfer of special characters / emojis &%*, it coverts and sends, later we need to decode it, with base64 decode, then we will be able to see the information
    - local_sensitive_content does not show the senstivie content in the terminal, we are able to see if it with cat 

3. data source - only requirment is filename, rest all will be read only 
    - starts with data "local_file" "filecreation" {
        filename="data.txt"
    }

    - all other elements are read only for data
